KSU Spring 2023 - Mobile Software Development - Group Project
Problem Statement

• Most people do not keep records of their car.
• This causes auto-shops to take advantage of the car owners because they do not have any records of past maintenance.
• Our app will be easy-to-use and readily available for any car owner to keep track of the maintenance and mileage on their cars.
• This will allow car owners to be more aware of what their car needs when getting maintenance done.

App Features

• Personal and Business travel expense tracker
• Personal and Business vehicle maintenance report
• Vehicle pictures, VIN, license plate, etc.
• Vehicle accident reports

Functionality Overview

• The user starts by signing into their account or creating a new one.
• If they have previously saved cars in their virtual garage, they will show up in the next screen.
• They can then click on one of their cars and see all information.
• They can then select any of the fields and enter their maintenance information.
• The user can also switch their preference between kilometers and miles for fuel usage.
• There is an option for dark mode as well.
• The user can add new cars to their virtual garage at any time, and it will be added to the database so everything will be saved.

Additional Information
